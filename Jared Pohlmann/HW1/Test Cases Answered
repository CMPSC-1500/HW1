Test Cases Answered

Problem 1: When run, my test cases proved to work where BunRun, Mud1234, and 2019Spartan were shown. Zombee and murk did not work since it is not on the list as expected. 

Problem 2: For the first sequence I got 4 groups with 1 person left out. This was expected and it worked verticallly as well. The next case I got 0 groups with 2 left over as expected. Then the next I got  0 groups with 1 left over. Then 4 groups with 0 left over. Finaly I got 3 groups with 0 left over.
