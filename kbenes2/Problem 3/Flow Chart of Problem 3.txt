Look at the first name. 

Use the first letter of the first name.

Look at the next letter of the first name. 
Alphabetically, if that letter comes before the first letter of the last name:
	Yes-- print that letter then move to next letter of first name
		Loop to "Look at the next letter of the first name"
	No-- print the last name only using 7 characters or less.

Then move on to the next person and start over loop beginning at using the first letter of the first name.

One of the loops will include looking at the first name and the last name of each person, then moving on to the next person.
