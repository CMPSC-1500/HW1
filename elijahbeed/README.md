I'm still not comfortable working with Java, so for the first problem I attempted to type it up in Java. The code doesn't fully 
work, but hopefully my intended effect is not lost. For the second and third problems I ended up creating flow charts for them
so that I could focus more on the logic behind them without worrying too much about putting them into actual, working code. 
You had mentioned that you felt the focus of this class should be on the logic behind programming, so I figured working out
flow charts would be the best way to do that since I'm not comfortable with the Java.
